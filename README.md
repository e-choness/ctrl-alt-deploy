# Unity Input System

Learn how Unity's new input system works.

## Delegate

- A variable to hold a reference to the function pointers;
- Action, Func, delegate, lambda expression are useful to produce clean and concise code;

## Interface

A contract to make sure the class has all the required function within its scope.
Interfaces can be used as Definitions to include all classes that include the same interface.

## Generics

Much like C++ template, you can generalize data types without having to specify them explicitly.

## Lambda Expressions

Paired with Input Action from Unity Input System, lambda expressions can be used to simplify the code and seperate the player inputs from gameplay logic.
