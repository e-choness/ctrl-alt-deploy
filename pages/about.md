## **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,
<br />
As a software engineer with a strong background in backend systems and cloud infrastructure for games. With experience in C#, C++, and Python, she builds scalable, reliable services and tools that empower development teams. Her passion lies in creating smooth online experiences and improving developer workflows through thoughtful engineering.
<br />
Working in the game industry for sometime, I realised that toolings and automation services in game development could greatly accelerate the project productivity. Hence a series of blogs about platform engineering is in order.
