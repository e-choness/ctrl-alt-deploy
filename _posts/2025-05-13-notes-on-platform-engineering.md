A digital platform is a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, service, knowledge and support which are arranged as a compelling internal product.

Platform team is a startup that builds the Internal Developer Platform as a product for their internal market

Why it matters: understanding devs' pain points and building a compelling product is the only way to ensure adoption.

Platform as a Product
Ownership: Instead of working on a "project" that is finished at a certain time, a platform team treats the platform as their product across the entire product life cycle

New perspective: Developers using the platform are treated like customers

Product management basics: User research, user centric design, product roadmap, feedback loops, product marketing, etc.
