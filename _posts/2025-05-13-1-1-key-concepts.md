_aka: How we stopped worrying and learned to stop developers from YOLO-ing their infrastructure._

### 🔹 **What Even _Is_ Platform Engineering?**

Platform engineering is the art (and frustration) of building internal platforms so developers can ship code without bricking production—or paging ops at 2 AM because their Docker container is stuck in restart hell.

It’s not about inventing the 17th deployment pipeline. It’s about designing reusable, sane defaults—_golden paths_—so teams don’t reinvent broken wheels with duct tape and YAML.

Think of it as:

> **“What if infrastructure teams thought like product teams, and developers had to write fewer support tickets?”**

---

### 🔹 **Key Concepts (with Eye Rolls and War Stories)**

#### 1. **Golden Paths / Paved Roads**

These are the “Do this and you won’t get yelled at” blueprints:

- Want to deploy a microservice? Use this template.
- Want metrics? Here’s a dashboard wired into Prometheus.
- Want to go rogue? Sure—but you're on your own, cowboy.

> 🧠 _Real talk:_ These are critical because developers are not infra experts, and they shouldn’t need to be. They want to deploy, not get a PhD in K8s RBAC.

**Industry example:** Netflix’s “Paved Roads” approach gives devs guardrails _without_ handcuffs—defaults that are safe, fast, and observable.

---

#### 2. **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)**

This is the engine room of platform engineering. A well-built IDP:

- Hides the messy stuff (Kubernetes, Terraform, secrets).
- Provides buttons that devs love to click (deploy, rollback, logs, metrics).
- Actually gets used—because the alternative is suffering.

> 🎯 _Critical view:_ Most IDPs fail when they’re built by infra teams _for themselves_, not for developers. If you build it and no one uses it, you’ve just created another abandoned internal tool with five Slack channels and zero users.

---

#### 3. **Self-Service (Without Self-Destruction)**

Let devs deploy, scale, and monitor their services **without filing a Jira ticket** or joining a 45-minute sync.

But self-service doesn’t mean _laissez-faire_. It means thoughtful automation:

- “Click to deploy” is cool—unless it nukes prod.
- “Click to revert” is cooler.

> ☠️ _Cautionary tale:_ A dev once had self-service access to production load balancer configs. Two clicks later, he brought down half of EMEA. So yeah, guardrails matter.

---

#### 4. **Platform as a Product**

This is where you stop calling yourself "the tools team" and start acting like a SaaS vendor—_your devs are your customers_.

- Roadmaps, feature requests, support tickets.
- NPS scores? Maybe. Emojis in Slack feedback? Definitely.

> 🛠 _Product thinking tip:_ If developers hate using your platform, they’ll circumvent it. Usually with shell scripts. Or worse—Ansible.

---

#### 5. **Enablement Over Enforcement**

Don’t play infra cop. Nobody likes the YAML police.

Instead:

- Offer supported, easy-to-use options.
- Let teams opt-in—then make those defaults so good, they’d be foolish not to.

> 💡 _Example:_ You can force teams to use Helm, or you can give them a “Click here to deploy a production-grade service with secrets, monitoring, and TLS” button. Guess which one scales?
