Nginx is a performance-oriented HTTP server capable of reverse proxying HTTP, HTTPS, and mail-related protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP). It also provides load balancing and HTTP caching. Its design fully utilizes an asynchronous event model, reducing context-switching overhead and improving server concurrency. With its modular design, it offers a rich set of official and third-party modules.

Key characteristics of Nginx include: **Asynchronous**, **Event-driven**, **Modular**, **High-performance**, **High-concurrency**, **Reverse Proxy**, and **Load Balancing**.

Below, we'll explore Nginx's application within Docker. For a general introduction to Nginx, please refer to introductory tutorials.

### Finding Images

Search for Nginx-related images on Docker Hub:

```bash
docker search nginx
```

This command will display a list of images, including the official Nginx image (`docker.io/nginx`) and various community-contributed images like `docker.io/jwilder/nginx-proxy`.

### Pulling Images

To download the official Nginx image:

```bash
docker pull nginx:latest
```

It's good practice to explicitly specify a tag like `latest` or a specific version (e.g., `nginx:1.25.3`) to ensure consistency.

### Starting a Container

To start a new container from the Nginx image:

```bash
docker run --name my-nginx -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

- `--name my-nginx`: Assigns the name `my-nginx` to the container.

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).

- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 80 inside the container. This allows you to access Nginx via `http://localhost:8080`.

- `nginx`: Specifies the Docker image to use.

**Note:** The original command included `/bin/bash` which would replace the default Nginx entrypoint, leading to the Nginx server not starting automatically. The corrected command above allows Nginx to run as intended.

### Viewing Logs

To check the container's runtime logs:

```bash
docker logs my-nginx
```

### Running a Container Example One (With Custom Configuration and Static Files)

To run a more complex Nginx example, mounting a custom `nginx.conf` and static web pages:

```bash
docker run --name my-nginx-custom \
    -v /host/path/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
    -v /some/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -d nginx
```

- `-v host_dir:container_dir[:ro|rw]`: The `-v` parameter (volume mount) syntax.

- `/host/path/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro`: Mounts a local `nginx.conf` file into the container as read-only (`ro`).

- `/some/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro`: Mounts a local directory containing static HTML files into the container as read-only (`ro`).

- `--name`: Assigns a name to the container.

- `-p`: Maps ports (e.g., `8080` on host to `80` in container).

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode.

### Running a Container Example Two (With SSL Certificates and Multiple Volumes)

For a scenario where the Nginx container needs to load free SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt and serve static resources from multiple directories:

1. **Create local directories for Nginx configurations and static content:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/_docker/nginx/conf.d
   mkdir -p ~/_docker/nginx/html
   ```

2. **It's better practice to create your `default.conf` (or other server blocks) and static content directly in your host directories rather than copying from a running container.** If you need an initial configuration, you can pull it from the official Nginx Docker image documentation or create a basic one.

   _Example `default.conf` for `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` on your host, before mounting:_

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com; # Replace with your domain

       location / {
           root /usr/share/nginx/html;
           index index.html index.htm;
       }

       # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
       if ($scheme = http) {
           return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
       }
   }

   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com; # Replace with your domain

       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/fullchain.pem; # Replace with your domain
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/privkey.pem; # Replace with your domain

       include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
       ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # If you generate this

       location / {
           root /usr/share/nginx/html;
           index index.html index.htm;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Nginx container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name webserver \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     -p 443:443 -p 80:80 \
     -v $HOME/_docker/nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
     -v $HOME/_docker/nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro \
     -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt:ro \
     -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
     -v /home/www:/home/www:ro \
     nginx
   ```

   - `--restart unless-stopped`: This is a more robust restart policy than `always`, which ensures the container restarts unless explicitly stopped by the user.

   - `-p 443:443 -p 80:80`: Maps host ports 443 and 80 to the container's ports 443 and 80, respectively.

   - `-v`: Volume mounts for:

     - `$HOME/_docker/nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro`: Static HTML content (read-only).

     - `$HOME/_docker/nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro`: Custom Nginx configuration files (read-only).

     - `/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt:ro`: Let's Encrypt certificates (read-only). This directory is usually managed by Certbot on the host.

     - `/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro`: Syncs the host's timezone into the container.

     - `/home/www:/home/www:ro`: Another directory for static resources (read-only).

   - `nginx`: The Nginx image.

### Interacting with the Container

To execute commands inside the running container (e.g., to debug or inspect files):

```bash
docker exec -it webserver /bin/bash
```

- `docker exec`: Executes a command in a running container.

- `-it`: Allocates a pseudo-TTY and keeps STDIN open, allowing interactive input.

- `webserver`: The name of your container.

- `/bin/bash`: The command to execute (starts a Bash shell).

### Reloading Nginx Configuration

After making changes to mounted configuration files, you can test and reload Nginx without restarting the container:

1. **Test Nginx configuration syntax:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it webserver nginx -t
   ```

2. **Reload Nginx configuration:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it webserver nginx -s reload
   ```

**Note:** `webserver` can be either the container name or its ID.

### Enabling GitLab Container Registry (Contextual Example)

This section details how to integrate Nginx (or a similar reverse proxy setup) with a GitLab Container Registry. This is often part of a larger CI/CD pipeline and involves configuring both GitLab and Docker.

1. Configure GitLab (if self-hosted):

   Edit /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb and set registry_external_url to the desired URL for your Docker registry, typically including the IP and port where your registry will be accessible.

   ```ruby
   registry_external_url 'http://192.168.188.211:5008'
   ```

   This `registry_external_url` is the address clients will use to `docker pull` or `docker push` images. After restarting GitLab, you should see the "Container Registry" menu on the left panel.

2. Configure Docker Daemon for Insecure Registries (if using HTTP or self-signed HTTPS):

   If your registry is running on HTTP or uses self-signed certificates, you'll need to configure your Docker daemon to trust it as an "insecure registry." Create or modify ~/.docker/daemon.json (on the host machine where Docker client is running):

   ```json
   {
     "insecure-registries": ["192.168.188.211:5008"]
   }
   ```

   After modifying `daemon.json`, restart the Docker daemon (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart docker` on Linux) for changes to take effect.

3. Log in to the GitLab Registry:

   As prompted by GitLab, log in to the registry using your GitLab credentials.

   ```bash
   docker login 192.168.188.211:5008
   Username: <your_gitlab_username>
   Password: <your_personal_access_token>
   ```

   **Important:** The password here is a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) generated in GitLab (`User Settings > Access Tokens > Add a personal access token`), not your regular GitLab account password. Ensure the token has the `read_registry` and `write_registry` scopes.

4. Build and Push an Image:

   Build a Docker image and tag it with the registry's address, then push it to your GitLab Container Registry.

   ```bash
   docker build -t 192.168.188.211:5008/docker/docker-static-service-template .
   docker push 192.168.188.211:5008/docker/docker-static-service-template
   ```

   This will build the image from the Dockerfile in your current directory (`.`) and then push it to the specified GitLab Registry path.
