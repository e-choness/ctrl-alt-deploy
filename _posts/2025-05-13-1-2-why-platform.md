title: 1.2 Why platform engineering has emerged
date: 2025-05-13 15:01:00
summary: Spoiler alert this is less a love letter to Platform Engineering and more a post-mortem of what happened when DevOps scaled beyond “two pizza teams” and became “three hundred Slack channels and a Terraform repo no one understands.”

## 🧨 **Why Platform Engineering Exists (aka: How DevOps Became Everyone’s Problem)**

### 🎤 **The DevOps Pitch (Back in the Day)**

DevOps began with noble intentions:

> “Let’s tear down the wall between Dev and Ops. Let developers own their code in production!”

In theory, this meant faster releases, better reliability, and fewer silos.

In practice? You got:

- Developers SSHing into prod to debug Nginx configs.
- Infra teams juggling Jenkins jobs, Kubernetes clusters, and heart medication.
- A conga line of YAML files with names like `final-final-prod-deploy.yaml`.

DevOps worked—**until it didn’t**.

### 🧱 **The Great Wall of Cognitive Load**

As companies grew, so did the toolchains:

- Containers! Kubernetes! Istio! Argo! Prometheus! Tekton! Spinnaker! Vault!
- Every engineer now had a part-time job as a platform operator—except with none of the access and all of the blame.

You can’t expect every developer to:

- Understand what a pod disruption budget is
- Know why their init container is stuck
- Or care about why your GitOps controller is in a crash loop.

> 🧠 **Reality check:** Developers want to ship features, not debug Helm charts from 2019 written by an intern who’s now doing crypto in Bali.

### 🔥 **The DevOps Burnout Spiral**

As DevOps scaled:

- Every team had their own “best practices.”
- Infra was duct-taped together with 17 Jenkins plugins and a wiki page titled “DO NOT TOUCH THIS.”
- On-call rotations started resembling psychological experiments.

> DevOps said, “You build it, you run it.”  
> But forgot to add, “...and also you own the IAM policies, TLS certs, logging infra, and whatever this Bash script does.”

The end result?  
A lot of tired engineers and a lot of apps held together with hope and retry loops.

## 🚀 **Enter Platform Engineering: The Adults Have Arrived**

Platform engineering stepped in not to kill DevOps, but to rescue it.

> It’s DevOps with guardrails. DevOps with a UX. DevOps without crying in `kubectl`.

Here’s what platform engineering changes:

- **Standardization**: One golden path to production—not 18 tribal variations.
- **Abstraction**: Devs click buttons. Platforms handle ingress, TLS, secrets, deployment, rollback.
- **Scale**: What works for 5 teams breaks for 50. Platforms scale good practices, not just pipelines.
- **Product thinking**: Internal platforms are versioned, supported, documented—just like SaaS.

> 🛠️ You still get self-service. But now it’s safe, observable, and supported by humans who understand both infrastructure _and_ humans.

### 🏢 **Real-World Examples**

- **Spotify** built Backstage so their devs wouldn’t have to think about infrastructure. They open-sourced it because every company was building something similar—and badly.
- **Airbnb**’s “Service Framework” ensures that all services are bootstrapped with observability, deployment pipelines, and compliance baked in.
- **Shopify**’s platform team treats platform products like commercial offerings—with feedback loops, usage metrics, and user interviews.

### 🧠 **Critical Take: Why This Matters**

DevOps didn’t fail—it just **wasn’t enough** on its own. It assumed that developers want to own the full stack.

But most developers just want to:

- Build features
- Not wake up at 3 AM
- And not become YAML archaeologists.

Platform engineering meets them halfway:

- You _can_ go off the paved road, but you better know what you're doing.
- You _can_ ship fast, but you're riding a platform built to not break prod.
